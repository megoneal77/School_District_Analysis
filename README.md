# School_District_Analysis
Analysis of School District
## Purpose
The purpose of the School District Analysis Challenge was to breakdown the reading and math scores for Thomas High School. According to district officials, ninth
graders at this high school were part of an academic dishonesty scheme, where the wide-spread ramifications have yet to be determined. Because of this, school officials
have done their best to keep the high academic standards fair for all students. To do this, the officals have reached out to Maria to get the ninth grade math and 
reading scores dropped from the counts for Thomas High School, then had the data revisited. 
## Results
The ningth grade results for math and reading scores were changed to NaN due to the evidence of academic dishonesty. This changed the averages for passing math and
reading as seen below:

    -How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
        -Math and reading scores by grade
          *Math and reading scores for Thomas High School were not changed for the remaining tenth--twelfth grades.The averages for the other schools remained the same
          however, the overall average for the district would have dropped.
        -Scores by school spending
          *The more the school spent, the lower the overall percentage for passing. This might be in part because an entire grade of classes was taken out of cout.

          *The larger the school size, the smaller the overall passig percentage. The largest school size has the smallest passing percentage.
        -Scores by school type
